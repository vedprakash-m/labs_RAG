# 🧪 Lab: Building a Healthcare RAG Pipeline using Vibe Coding
*Author: Ved Mishra - 9/22/2025 | Optimized for Learning & Discovery*

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this lab, you'll have a **working healthcare knowledge system** that can answer medical questions like:
- *"What are normal blood pressure ranges?"*
- *"What blood sugar levels indicate diabetes?"*
- *"What lifestyle changes prevent heart disease?"*

**Your Achievement**: A complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built entirely through **vibe coding** - where you describe what you want and AI builds it for you.

---

## 🤔 What is Vibe Coding?

**Traditional Coding:**
```python
# 50+ lines of manual Azure connection code
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
# ... complex manual setup ...
```

**Vibe Coding:**
```
Create a script that connects to Azure and uploads healthcare PDFs with progress tracking and error handling.
```
→ *AI generates the complete working code!*

**Key Insight**: You become an **AI conductor** - orchestrating systems through conversation rather than writing every line of code. Your workflow changes from writing every line to a powerful new loop: **prompt → generate → review → refine → debug**.

**The Reality**: Vibe coding isn't magic - it's an iterative conversation where you:
1. **Prompt**: Describe what you want clearly and specifically
2. **Generate**: AI creates a strong first draft
3. **Review**: You examine the code and identify gaps or issues  
4. **Refine**: Guide the AI to improve specific aspects
5. **Debug**: Test and iterate until it works perfectly

This approach lets you focus on **system design** and **problem-solving** instead of syntax and boilerplate. **The more specific your prompt, the better the AI's first draft will be.**

[ ] Step 4: Test Your System
[ ] 🎉 Celebrate: You built RAG with AI!
```

### Step 1: Quick Environment Setup (5 minutes)

💡 **What We're Doing**: Setting up your workspace and getting Azure ready

**Create Your Workspace:**
1. Create folder: `C:\dev\my-first-rag`
2. Open in VS Code: `File → Open Folder`
3. Open terminal: `Ctrl + \``

**Simple Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create a basic Python setup script for a healthcare RAG project that:
1. Creates a virtual environment
2. Installs essential packages: azure-storage-blob, azure-search-documents, openai, langchain, python-dotenv
3. Creates a simple project structure: docs/, src/, .env
4. Shows success messages for each step

Make it beginner-friendly with clear progress indicators.
```

**Execute & Verify:**
- Run the generated script
- **✅ Early Win**: You should see success messages and folders created

### Step 2: Simple Azure Setup (8 minutes)

💡 **What We're Doing**: Creating your cloud services with one prompt

**Copilot Prompt:** 
```
Create a PowerShell script that sets up basic Azure resources for RAG:
1. Login to Azure and list subscriptions
2. Create resource group "rg-labs-rag" in eastus2
3. Create storage account with name "stlabsrag" + random suffix and "health-docs" container
4. Create Azure AI Search service with name "srch-labs-rag" + random suffix (use free tier)
5. Create Azure OpenAI with name "aoai-labs-rag" and deploy text-embedding-3-small and gpt-4o-mini models
6. Generate .env file with all keys and endpoints
7. Print a success summary with resource names and estimated monthly costs

If resources already exist with these names, append a timestamp or random number.
```

**🔧 Quick Test:**
- Run the script
- **✅ Early Win**: Check Azure portal - you should see your new resources!

### Step 3: Generate Healthcare Documents (5 minutes)

💡 **What We're Doing**: Creating realistic medical content for our system

**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create a simple Python script that generates 2 realistic healthcare PDFs:

Document 1 - Blood Pressure Guide (500 words):
- Normal: <120/80 mmHg
- Elevated: 120-129/<80 mmHg  
- Stage 1: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
- Stage 2: ≥140/90 mmHg
- Include lifestyle recommendations

Document 2 - Diabetes Basics (500 words):
- Normal blood sugar: <100 mg/dL fasting
- Prediabetes: 100-125 mg/dL fasting
- Diabetes: ≥126 mg/dL fasting
- Include management tips

Use reportlab to create actual PDFs in docs/ folder.
Include progress messages and file verification.
```

**✅ Quick Verification:**
- Check `docs/` folder for 2 PDF files
- Open one PDF to verify content looks medical and realistic

### Step 4: Build Your RAG System (15 minutes)

💡 **What We're Doing**: Creating your RAG pipeline step-by-step so you understand each component

#### Step 4a: Create the Upload Script (5 minutes)

**💡 Why This First**: Before we can search documents, we need to get them into Azure Blob Storage. This is the **data ingestion** part of our pipeline.

**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create a Python script named upload.py that:
1. Connects to Azure Blob Storage using credentials from .env file
2. Uploads all PDFs from the local 'docs/' folder to the container
3. Shows a progress message for each file uploaded
4. Confirms successful uploads with file names and sizes
5. Handles errors gracefully with helpful messages

Make it simple and well-commented for learning purposes.
```

**🔧 Quick Test**: Run `python upload.py` - you should see your PDFs being uploaded to Azure.

#### Step 4b: Create the Indexing Script (5 minutes)

**💡 Why This Second**: Now that files are in the cloud, we need to make them **searchable**. This script converts documents into AI-friendly "chunks" and "embeddings" (vectors that represent meaning).

**Key Concepts**:
- **Chunking**: Breaking a long document into searchable paragraphs (~300 characters each)
- **Embeddings**: Converting text into numbers so AI can find similar concepts, not just keywords
- **Vector Search**: Finding chunks that are conceptually similar to your question

**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create an index.py script that:
1. Downloads PDFs from our Azure blob container
2. Uses LangChain's PyPDFLoader to extract text from PDFs
3. Splits text into 300-character chunks with 50-character overlap (preserves context)
4. Uses Azure OpenAI embedding model to create vector representations
5. Stores chunks and their vectors in Azure AI Search index
6. Shows progress: "Processing doc 1/2", "Created 15 chunks", "Uploaded to search index"
7. Displays final summary: total chunks indexed

Include clear error handling and explanatory comments.
```

**🔧 Quick Test**: Run `python index.py` - you should see chunks being created and uploaded to your search index.

#### Step 4c: Create the Query Script (5 minutes)

**💡 Why This Last**: This is where the magic happens! This script performs **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** - it finds relevant chunks and uses them to generate accurate answers.

**The RAG Process**:
1. Convert your question into an embedding (same format as document chunks)
2. Find the most similar chunks using vector search  
3. Feed those chunks + your question to GPT-4o-mini
4. Generate an answer based on your specific documents

**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create a query.py script that:
1. Takes a user question from command line input
2. Creates an embedding for the question using Azure OpenAI
3. Searches Azure AI Search to find top 3 most relevant document chunks
4. Creates a prompt combining the user question with retrieved chunks
5. Sends this enhanced prompt to GPT-4o-mini for answer generation
6. Displays the answer with source attribution (which documents were used)
7. Includes medical disclaimer: "This is for educational purposes only"

Show the relevance scores and chunk sources for transparency.
```

**🔧 Quick Test**: Run `python query.py` and ask "What are normal blood pressure ranges?"

### Step 5: Test Your Complete RAG System (2 minutes)

**Run Your Pipeline:**
```powershell
python upload.py    # Step 1: Upload documents to cloud
python index.py     # Step 2: Create searchable AI index  
python query.py     # Step 3: Start asking questions!
```

**Test Questions:**
- "What are normal blood pressure ranges?"
- "What blood sugar levels indicate diabetes?"
- "What lifestyle changes prevent heart disease?"

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- You get answers with source references
- Response time under 10 seconds
- Medical disclaimer included
- Relevance scores visible

### 🎉 Congratulations!

You just built a complete RAG system using vibe coding! Your system can now:
- ✅ Store healthcare documents in the cloud
- ✅ Understand and search medical content
- ✅ Answer questions with proper sources
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully

### 🔄 Level Up: Refactoring for Readability (Optional - 5 minutes)

💡 **What We're Doing**: Our three scripts work great, but for real projects, we'd organize them better. Let's use AI to refactor our code into a cleaner structure - this shows how vibe coding helps with code improvement, not just initial creation.

**The Transformation:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Before: Separate Scripts"
        A[upload.py]
        B[index.py] 
        C[query.py]
    end
    subgraph "After: Organized Class"
        D[pipeline.py<br/>HealthcareRAGPipeline Class]
    end
    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    
    style A fill:#ffebee
    style B fill:#ffebee
    style C fill:#ffebee
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Take the logic from my upload.py, index.py, and query.py files and refactor them into a single Python class called HealthcareRAGPipeline in a new file pipeline.py. 

The class should have these methods:
- __init__(self) - loads configuration from .env
- upload_documents(self) - uploads PDFs to blob storage  
- create_index(self) - processes documents and creates search index
- ask_question(self, question) - performs RAG query and returns answer

Include proper error handling, logging, and docstrings. Make it professional and maintainable.
```

**💡 Why This Matters**: This demonstrates a key vibe coding skill - using AI not just for initial development, but for **code quality improvement**. In real projects, you'll constantly refactor and enhance your AI-generated code.

**🤔 Reflection Questions:**
- What did the AI understand from your prompts?
- How is this different from manual coding?
- What would you ask for next?

## 🧹 Resource Cleanup (Important!)

💡 **Why We Do This**: To avoid unnecessary Azure costs, it's a Microsoft best practice to delete all resources when finished with a project. This is especially important for engineers working with company Azure subscriptions.

### ⚠️ Safe Manual Cleanup (Recommended)

**Step 1: Verify Your Resources**
```powershell
# List YOUR specific resource group (replace <your-alias> with your actual alias)
az group show --name "rg-<your-alias>-rag" --output table

# List all resources in YOUR resource group to confirm they're yours
az resource list --resource-group "rg-<your-alias>-rag" --output table
```

**Step 2: Check Costs Before Deletion**
- Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) → Cost Management
- Filter by your resource group to see actual costs
- Screenshot for your records if needed

**Step 3: Safe Deletion**
```powershell
# Only delete YOUR resource group (double-check the name!)
az group delete --name "rg-<your-alias>-rag" --yes
```

### 🤖 Alternative: AI-Generated Cleanup Script

**Only if you prefer automation - Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create a PowerShell cleanup script that:
1. Prompts user to enter their Microsoft alias
2. Lists resources in "rg-{alias}-rag" resource group specifically  
3. Shows estimated costs for these resources
4. Requires user to type "DELETE rg-{alias}-rag" exactly to confirm
5. Validates the resource group name contains their alias
6. Deletes only that specific resource group
7. Confirms successful deletion

Include multiple safety checks to prevent accidental deletion of wrong resources.
Add warnings if no resources found or if trying to delete non-matching names.
```

**✅ Cleanup Verification:**
- Check Azure Portal - your specific resource group should be gone
- No ongoing charges for deleted resources
- Keep .env file if you want to recreate resources later
